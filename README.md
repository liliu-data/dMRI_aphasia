# MRI Preprocessing Pipeline

This project implements a preprocessing workflow for diffusion MRI data, designed during my internship at the Donders Institute.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- FSL (BET, eddy)
- Unix Shell Scripting
- Python
- TrackVis, StarTrack

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
- Automated artifact correction and DTI fitting

## ðŸ§  Context
Used in a clinical study on post-stroke aphasia to streamline and standardize imaging analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- use mask.sh to create brain masks for all of your subjects
- use eddy.sh to correct eddy current distortion
- use extractdata.py to extract the statistical data derived from TrackVis to an .csv sheet
